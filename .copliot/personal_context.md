# Personal Coding Context for Shravan-HabitNu

## AI Interaction Preferences
- **Reasoning Style**: Prefers multistage chain of thought approach
  - Wants AIs to be self reflective and validate and correct themselves
  - Break complex problems into sequential steps
  - Build reasoning progressively through multiple stages
  - Show intermediate conclusions before final solutions
  - Don't jump directly to answers - walk through the thinking process

- **Self-Review Requirement**: MUST review and analyze own responses before finalizing
  - After generating any response (text/code/solution), pause and self-analyze
  - Check for accuracy, completeness, better approaches
  - Refine or improve the response if needed
  - Show the review process when significant changes are made

## Coding Style & Preferences
- **Problem-solving approach**: Asks for alternatives and trade-offs ("is there no single command instead?")
- **Performance awareness**: Cares about query efficiency and index usage
- **Conciseness preference**: Prefers shorter, cleaner solutions when possible

## AI Interaction Patterns
- **Question style**: Direct, practical questions ("how do u reckon...", "is there a way...")
- **Learning approach**: Wants to understand WHY solutions work, not just HOW
- **Context building**: Appreciates when AI remembers conversation context
- **Explanation preference**: Likes both quick answers AND detailed explanations
- **Reasoning preference**: Wants multistage chain of thought, not direct answers
- **Quality expectation**: Expects AI to self-review and refine responses

## Technical Knowledge Level
- **MongoDB**: Comfortable with aggregation pipelines, wants optimization tips
- **Python**: Uses datetime, timezone handling, database integration
- **AI/Prompting**: Transitioning from template-based to semantic approaches
- **Architecture thinking**: Considers semantic vs mechanical approaches for better AI responses

## Communication Style
- Uses casual language ("u", "cuz", "gonna")
- Appreciates friendly, conversational AI responses
- Asks follow-up questions to dig deeper
- Values practical, actionable advice

## Areas of Interest/Growth
- AI prompt engineering (semantic vs template approaches)
- Database performance optimization
- Memory/context persistence in AI conversations
- Clean architecture patterns
- Multistage reasoning and chain of thought methodologies
- Self-reflective AI system design
